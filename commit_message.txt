feat(camera): Replace camera toggle with mode dropdown

Replaces the simple camera toggle button with a more versatile dropdown menu, allowing users to select from multiple camera perspectives.

New camera modes include:
- Panning (the original default)
- FPV (First-Person View)
- Behind
- Ride Along
- Oncoming

refactor(physics): Improve simulation stability and performance

- Adjusts Cannon.js world parameters (solver iterations, tolerance, sleep settings) to reduce clipping and improve performance.
- Tweaks contact material properties for softer, more stable collisions.
- Correctly applies rotations to track pieces for accurate physics calculations, fixing issues with angled walls.

refactor(gameplay): Enhance lead marble tracking and FPV camera

- The logic for determining the lead marble now correctly calculates the marble closest to a finish line, rather than the furthest from the start. This provides a more accurate race ranking.
- The FPV camera has been repositioned and its look-at logic adjusted for a more immersive and stable first-person experience.
